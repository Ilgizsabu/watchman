# Watchman Syndrome:

Make a form for login and password verification. There should be two fields in the form - one for login, one for password and a ‘Login’ button. Logins and passwords existing in the system should be stored in some variable. In case of an error - show it (learn from existing forms). If everything is correct, hide the form and show the text `Hello, <login>` in the interface. Instead of `<login>` substitute the login that was entered in the form.
